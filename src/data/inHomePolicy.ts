      "Almost all damages are a nick or scratch on the piece of wood furniture. Wood furniture can almost always be repaired by a professional company. If a glass top or a mirror was broken a new piece could easily be custom cut to replace the broken piece. If an item could not be repaired a settlement offer would be given considering current market value. All repair/settlement decisions that are above the state’s 60 cents per lbs requirement, are made at MoveCo.net’s sole discretion. We get most of our business for referrals this is a means of promoting customer service.",
